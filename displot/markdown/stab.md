# **displot** - Dislocation Counter

---

Repository address: [https://github.com/bjstarosta/displot](https://github.com/bjstarosta/displot)

Use the "File" menu to load images into the program. Only 8-bit greyscale TIF
images with no alpha channel are supported, support for more may be added based
on need. The dislocation detection method is currently crude, but should improve
in further releases as we put together datasets for training a machine learning
algorithm. For now, expect to have to heavily help it along by marking
dislocations that have been missed and unmarking false positives - the UI is
designed to be as helpful with regards to that as possible. If you want to
discuss anything about this program further, email me at
[bohdan.starosta@strath.ac.uk](mailto:bohdan.starosta@strath.ac.uk) or use the GitHub issue
tracker.

This is a first release version, there may be bugs. If a new version is
released, expect a dialog nagging you to upgrade.
